Comp584 Final Project:
As primary assignment for this class you will build an advanced Web application. The required components of the applications are the following:

Single Page Application (SPA) - this is a "must" for C or above!
Model-View-Controller (MVC)
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) *
Authentication
Deployment
* Your application should include at least two tables with one-to-many relationship between them.

Fulfilling these requirements will make B grade.

We are going to build this application throughout the class. Server side requires ASP.NET/C#. I will use and recommend Angular on the client, however, you can use React on the client as well.

Other ways to get to A are the following:

Authorization
Complex Data Entry (Reactive Forms)
Server-initiated communications (e.g., SignalR)
Unit Testing
Third-party Identity Providers (e.g., Okta or Ping Identity)
I am open to other suggestions as well.
